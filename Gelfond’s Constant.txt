Gelfond’s Constant


Gelfond’s Constant is a Transcendental Number,  a Transcendental Number is a number which is not an Algebraic number. This constant is named after Aleksandr Gelfond and it is represented as
‘eπ’  that is e raised to the power Pie.


The value of Gelfond’s constant is:
eπ  =23.14069263277926900572908636794854738………


           eπ= (eπi )-i= (-1)-i


Here i is imaginary, Since -i is no algebraic, we can say eπ is Transcendental 


USAGE:
This constant is used in 
* Gelfond–Schneider theorem,
* Hilbert's seventh problem,
* Ramanjuna’s Constant.


CONSTRUCTION:
Assume   k0=  1/√2  and
  

When n > 0 the sequence expands and becomes
